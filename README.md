# Pomodoro-app-React

In this project I will develop an app of time management called pomodoro method. This method consist in be focus in your task for 25 minutes with 5 minutes break, after four cicles one have a 15 or 30 minutes break.

The original pomodoro is based on this time, but some people use diferent times on the focus and break periods, so thinking on this I will develop features so can the user can change this times. And the technologies will be React.
